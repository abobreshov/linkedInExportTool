#####LinkedIn bans me. Can't get access to LinkedIn site. What should I do?

Due to [LinkedIn limitations](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/throttle-limits) you can't export more than 1.5K per day. The idea of limits is that you can't visit more than 1.5K pages per day. If you do so you will be banned by the end of a day (UTC 00:00). 

In order to extract information about contact export tool gets contact's page witch affect limitations. The best way to work with export tool extension and LinkedIn during the day is to change limits on LinkedIn Export Tool settings page (I suggest to set it ~1K and it is by default).

![Set Limits]({{ site.url }}/images/settings-limits.PNG){: .pull-right}

You should find a balance between automatic export and manual work with LinkedIn.
