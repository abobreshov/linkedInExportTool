My name is Alexandr Bobreshov and I am a developer. I have a full time job and LinkedIn Export Tool for Chrome is my side project. 

LinkedIn Export Tool is absolutly free and the tool does not show you any ads.
But due to road map, LinkedIn changes and users requests it takes a lot of my free time to support and continue developing the project. I use to plan of making the tool not free and organize subscription. But it is not common for Chrome Web Store and LinkedIn can change something wich means that I can't 100% gurantee that 100% information can be exported. So I changed my mind and makes tool absolutly free.

I just want you to support my project. If my tool helps you to find rigth candidate or lead or just save your time or may be you has a change request or want a new feature please support the project and donate.

I will really apritiate any feedback from you and for sure I appretiate any donation that says the tool is useful and I do not spoil my free time.
