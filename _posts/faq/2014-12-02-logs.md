In order to write logs you need to switch on debug mode under the extension settings page.

![Debug Mode]({{ site.url }}/images/debug-mode-01.PNG)

After that logs will be written during export contacts. Just try to export conntacts and go to the extension settings and dowload the log file. Than send it via email with problem description.
