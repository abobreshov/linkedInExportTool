If you run into any issue and whant to fix it, please, write an email with description and logs (if possible) to [me](mailto:li.exporttool@gmail.com).

In order to write logs you need to switch on debug mode under the extension option page (chrome://extensions/).

![Debug Mode]({{ site.url }}/images/debug-mode-01.PNG)

After that logs will be written during export contacts. Just try to export conntacts and go to the extension settings and dowload the log file. Than send it via email with problem description.
