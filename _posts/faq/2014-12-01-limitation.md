Due to [LinkedIn limitations](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/throttle-limits) you can't export more than 1.5K per day. The idea of limits is that you can't visit more than 1.5K pages per day. If you do so you will be banned by the end of a day (UTC 00:00). 

In order to export reach inforation about contact export tool gets contact's page. In this case the best way to work with export and LinkedIn during the day, please, set limits option on LinkedIn Export Tool settings page (I suggest to set it ~1K).
You should find a balance between automatic export and maual work with LinkedIn.
